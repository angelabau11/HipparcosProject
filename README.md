# 🌌 Stellar Data Analysis with the Hipparcos Catalogue

This project explores a subset of data from the **Hipparcos** satellite mission — the first space-based astrometric observatory — which measured positions, parallaxes, and motions of stars between 1989 and 1993. This project was developed as part of the data analysis course at Universität Bonn. 

We use a cleaned version of the Hipparcos catalogue ([van Leeuwen, 2007](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0708.1752.pdf)) to investigate stellar properties such as distance, motion, and color. The dataset includes over 100,000 stars with five-parameter astrometric solutions.

## 🔍 Project Goals

- Load and clean real astronomical data using Python
- Visualize stellar motion and color indices
- Derive physical insights from parallax and proper motion
- Explore relationships between color (B-V, V-I) and stellar types

## 📁 Dataset

- Source: [Hipparcos Catalogue - van Leeuwen (2007)](https://vizier.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/VizieR-3?-source=I/311/hip2)
- Format: CSV with 15 features including RA, DEC, parallax, magnitude, and color
- Subset: Only stars with five-parameter astrometric solutions
